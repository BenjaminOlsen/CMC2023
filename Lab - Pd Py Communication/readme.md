# Python <--> Pd Communication 

In this lab we will discuss how to use OSC protocol for easily communicating between python and pd! 

To be able to run these examples locally, you need to install **python-osc** library:
    
    pip install python-osc

The are three examples in this lab:
- **Example A**:  Pd to Python communication 
- **Example A**:  Python to Pd communication 
- **Example A**:  Two-way communication 

For each example, refer to the corresponding sub-directory
